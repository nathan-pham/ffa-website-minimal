Hello members!

Thank you for your interest in joining Del Oro FFA. It is a pleasure to welcome you to our group. 

FFA is a youth organization where members can explore possibilities in leadership and agriculturally-based career development. As a new member, you will have the opportunity to participate in competitions, join event committees, engage with the community, manage animals or plant systems, earn scholarships, develop character skills, meet new people, and have fun in the process. 

We’re planning some special events right now. Contact your advisor or the officer team to join an event committee and get involved!

- Eggplant Festival - 10/2
- Second Chapter Meeting - 10/6
- Homecoming Float - 10/18 to 10/22
- Harvest Festival & Trunk or Treat  - 10/31
- Tri-Tip Dinner - 11/18

Our theme is “rising from the rubble”. This year, we commit to building new traditions and legacies by creating a welcoming environment, promoting opportunities, bettering ourselves in competition, and improving our campus presence. 

Please join our Remind list, where we post important reminders and work day announcements. Check out our social media handle and website for more general information.
