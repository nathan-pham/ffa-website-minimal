# FFA Website Minimal

## Improvements

> Looks great!! The animating flowers and seeds are really cool, but there is a margin on the element they are in on mobile..i'd remove that for a bit more immersion :)  
> -- zoroknash

-   more responsive (hero didn't quite fit on iPhone SE)
-   removed margin on all pages so canvas stretches full width

> I love the liquid animation on mobile when you open the navbar, could you please share how you achieved that? The website looks very clean honestly, well done, but is there any chance you could add a dark mode?
> -- D3V1nh10

-   custom hooks for easier animations
-   fully responsive dark mode
